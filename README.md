# PHP to HTML Form Generator
### I hate the name "Generator" - But that's what it is!

This is a simple class meant to aid you in creating forms, this is a usefull class alone when creating forms, though is mainly meant for aiding form creation on the JEK Framework http://github.com/halesyy/jek-framework, since it has some functions meant for the frontend-usage, just ignore them if you're using it with your PHP script alone!
